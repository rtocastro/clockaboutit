## Installation

Don't need anything other than a browser that can run HTML 5 documents. 

## Usage

Type in what you want into the scheduler and it will save it locally to your storage on your browswer ready to come back up when needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

My teacher Luigi Campbell, MDN and W3 schools for references on how to tie everything together. 


Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
